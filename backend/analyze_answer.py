SCORING RUBRIC:
1. CONTENT QUALITY (0-50 pts): depth, accuracy, examples, STAR structure.
   40-50=Exceptional, 28-39=Good, 15-27=Weak, 0-14=Poor
2. RELEVANCE (0-30 pts): how directly the answer addresses the question.
   25-30=Direct, 17-24=Mostly, 8-16=Partial, 0-7=Irrelevant
3. TIME EFFICIENCY (0-20 pts): optimal use of allotted time.

RULES:
- Score the CANDIDATE'S ANSWER only, not the suggested answer.
- overall_score = content_score + relevance_score + time_score (max 100).
- Also score clarity_score, technical_depth_score, confidence_score (each 0-100).
